    <h1 class="display-5 text-center">Let's talk about Infinity:</h1>
    <br>
    <h4>
    So first let's start with something we've all heard about before: Infinity.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h6>
        Generally, Infinity is regarded as "the largest number." <br>
        We usually say how we've been to school an infinite number of times <br>
        ... or even the time your brother stole an infinite number of candy from you. <br>
        But the catch is, it's not a number at all!
    </h6>
    <br><br>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md">
            <img src="/static/infinity.png" alt="Infinity Symbol">
          </div>
          <div class="col-md">
            <img src="/static/notequaltosymbol.jpg" width = "200" height = "200" alt="Not Equal To Symbol">
          </div>
          <div class="col-md">
            <img src="/static/number.png" width = "200" height = "200" alt="Number Symbol">
          </div>
        </div>

    <h1>Let's look at an example:</h1>
        <h6> 
            How many numbers are there between 1 and 2?
        </h6>
        <h6>
            Well there's 1.1 <br>
            But also 1.11 <br>
            But also 1.111 <br>
            There are an infinite amount of numbers between 1 and 2!
        </h6>
        <h6>
            In short, infinity is a "concept."
        </h6>
        <br><br><br>
    <div class="container text-center border border-5 ">
        <h1 class="display-4 container text-center">Let's look at this with a broad picture:</h1>
        
        <h6>
            Here's a pizza. We all love pizza right? 
        </h6>
        <img src="/static/Pizzaslice2.jpg" width = "300" hieght= "300" alt="...">
        <br>
        <h6>
            We can all agree that 1/2 of the pizza is shaded in.
        </h6>
        <br><br><br>
        <img src="/static/Pizzaslice3.jpg" width = "300" hieght= "300" alt="..."> 
        <h6>
            And here's 1/3 of a pizza. Pretty standard so far right? <br>
            So what happens... if we keep decreasing each slice? 
        </h6>
        <br><br><br>
        <img src="/static/Pizzaslice80.jpg" width = "300" height = "300">
        <h6> Let's look at 1/80, pretty tiny huh? <br>
            This is very close to 0: In fact, its decimal value is 0.0125, about 1.25% of the pizza. <br>
        </h6>
        <br><br><br>
        <h6> So now let's consider 1 over infinity. What would that look like? Would it even look like anything? <br>
            Remember, we just established that infinity is not a number. But what does that mean for our pizza slice? <br>
            We can't just say the pizza slice is gone because in theory, the pizza slice will be so small we can't even imagine it. <br>
            1 over infinity is infinitely close to 0, but it's not actually 0, because there are many other infinites standing between our 1 over infinity! <br>
            We say 1 over infinity, "goes to 0." It's infinitely small, but not small enough to be nothing yet.
        </h6>
        <br>
        <h6>
            In mathematical notation, we write it as a limit:
